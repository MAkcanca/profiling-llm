      "reasoning": [
        "**Age Range:** Surveillance footage indicates a 'middle-aged individual'. The timeline from a workplace injury in the early 2000s to present day suggests someone who was working age then and is now middle-aged.",
        "**Gender:** Surveillance footage depicts an 'individual'. The context of workplace injury in utilities, a historically male-dominated field, and the general absence of female offenders in bombing cases, suggests the offender is likely male.",
        "**Employment:** The grievance against Eastern Grid Utilities points to a work history with the company, likely in a role where workplace injuries are possible (skilled or semi-skilled).",
        "**Marital Status:** Unknown but 'likely single or socially isolated' is inferred from the sustained grievance, lack of direct social interaction in communications, and the nature of the lone-actor offending.",
        "**Living Arrangements:** 'Likely lives alone' is suggested by the lack of identified associates and the solitary nature of the planning and execution. 'Within the city or close proximity' is based on the Marauder spatial classification (see k43).",
        "**Education/Intelligence:** The construction of devices, particularly later ones with electronic timing mechanisms, indicates technical skill and practical intelligence. However, grammatical errors in communications suggest potentially lower formal education in English or non-native speaker status. Planning and organization are evident in the methodical approach and long-term campaign."

      "anger_management": "Anger is expressed in a controlled and methodical manner, escalating over time in sophistication but not necessarily in lethality. Initial phase was symbolic (notes, crude devices), escalating to more impactful but still intentionally non-lethal devices. Anger is channeled into planning and execution.",
      "reasoning": [
        "**Personality:** The consistent theme of grievance against EGU, the 'lives you ruin' note, 'fair consideration' demands, and 'justice will be served' communications clearly indicate a disgruntled and revenge-focused personality. The sustained nature of the campaign over years suggests a deep-seated grudge and potential for paranoid ideation regarding EGU.",
        "**Need for Power/Control:** The offender's actions are designed to exert control over EGU's narrative and force a response. However, the focus remains on his specific grievance rather than a broader power motive. The control is instrumental to achieving recognition and compensation.",
        "**Social Skills:** The indirect nature of the attacks, reliance on written/digital communications, and lack of interpersonal interaction point to poor social skills and potential social isolation. Direct confrontation is avoided in favor of symbolic and disruptive acts.",
        "**Stressors:** The repeated references to a workplace injury in the 'early 2000s', 'condition from their negligence', and 'uncompensated' status highlight the unresolved injury and its financial and emotional consequences as primary stressors.",

        "**Anger Expression:** The progression from notes to increasingly sophisticated devices shows a controlled escalation of anger. The devices, while potentially harmful, have been intentionally non-lethal, suggesting a desire for impact and attention rather than indiscriminate killing.

This 'instrumental violence' is directed towards achieving a specific goal.",
        "**Victim Interaction:** The lack of direct victim interaction and the selection of symbolic targets (EGU facilities, public spaces) demonstrate that the offender's focus is on the institution and the public, not individual victims. Injuries to individuals are collateral.",

        "**Previous Crimes:** The highly specific and grievance-driven nature of the offending suggests it is not part of a broader criminal pattern. The focus on EGU and compensation is very specific, unlike generalized criminal behavior.",
        "**Escalation Risk:** The trend of increasing device sophistication and the sustained, unresolved grievance strongly indicate a high risk of escalation. Frustration and a desire for greater impact could lead to more dangerous devices or more vulnerable targets.",
        "**Crime Documentation:** The communications are a form of self-documentation, explaining the motives and rationale behind the attacks. This is a key behavioral element, highlighting the communicative and grievance-driven nature of the offender.",
