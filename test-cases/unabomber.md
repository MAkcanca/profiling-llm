INCIDENT SUMMARY
On November 12, 1989, at approximately 10:15 AM EST, a package delivered through the United States Postal Service detonated at the offices of Northwood Research Institute. The package was addressed to Dr. Robert Garrison, who opened it at his desk. The explosion resulted in significant injuries to Dr. Garrison and minor injuries to an administrative assistant in an adjacent office.
VICTIM INFORMATION

Name: Dr. Robert Garrison, Ph.D.
Age: 42
Occupation: Senior Researcher, Northwood Research Institute
Professional Background: Computer science researcher specializing in pattern recognition algorithms
Medical Status: Victim sustained injuries to hands, face, and torso. Currently in stable condition at Massachusetts General Hospital.

SCENE EXAMINATION
Location Details

Mid-size research office on third floor of five-story building
Package was opened at victim's desk in private office
Blast damage confined primarily to immediate desk area with window damage
Adjacent offices sustained minor damage from pressure wave

Physical Evidence Recovered

Package Remnants:

Brown kraft paper fragments with adhesive residue
Partial shipping label with typed address
Postal markings indicating processing through Oakland, CA distribution center
Postmarked November 8, 1989


Device Components:

Fragments of hand-crafted wooden box (approximately 8" x 6" x 2")
Battery components (consistent with 9-volt type)
Copper wire fragments with distinctive cutting pattern
Spring mechanism components
Metal pipe fragments (appears to be main explosive container)
Metal fragments (common nails and screws, likely added as shrapnel)


Trace Evidence:

Wood splinters (preliminary analysis indicates pine with hand-planed surface)
Explosive residue samples collected from multiple surfaces
Adhesive samples from package sealing
Tool mark impressions in wooden components



DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS
Based on recovered components and witness statements, the device appears to be:

Contained within a handcrafted wooden box
Triggered by opening the package/lid
Constructed primarily of common, untraceable materials
Assembled with considerable technical skill and craftsmanship
Designed to cause maximum injury to the person opening the package

CHAIN OF CUSTODY

Scene secured by Cambridge PD at 10:23 AM
FBI Evidence Response Team arrived at 11:45 AM

SIMILAR INCIDENTS
This incident bears similarities to six previous mail bombing cases reported between 1985-1989:

Northwestern University (1985) - Engineering Department
University of Michigan (1985) - Research Laboratory
California Technology Firm (1987) - Executive Office
Utah Biological Sciences Center (1987) - Researcher's Home
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1987) - Faculty Office
Pennsylvania Robotics Laboratory (1988) - Package Intercepted

Common elements in these cases include:

Academic or technological industry targets
Package delivery method
Handcrafted wooden containers
Similar explosive mechanisms
No recoverable fingerprints or DNA
No clear personal connection between victims

PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

Device constructed with methodical attention to detail
No electrical or factory-made timing mechanisms
No fingerprints or other biological evidence recovered
No explicit messages or communications included with device
Materials appear deliberately selected to be untraceable
Postal routing suggests mailing origin in Northern California area
