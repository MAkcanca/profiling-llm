He is organized, methodical, and displays a need for impersonal power and control, directed towards academic and technological institutions. His motivation appears rooted in perceived grievances against these sectors, fueling fantasies of disruption and intellectual superiority. The offender is geographically mobile or utilizes mail systems to project his actions from a distance (commuter pattern). He is aware of forensic procedures and takes steps to avoid detection, indicating a calculated and risk-averse approach. The professional NAS archetype classification is supported by the methodical nature of the crimes, while SHPA classifications are not applicable due to the absence of sexual elements. Spatial behavior indicates a commuter pattern, based on the mailing of devices from a potentially distant location."
