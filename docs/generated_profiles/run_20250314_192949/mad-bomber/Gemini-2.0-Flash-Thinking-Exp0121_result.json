Current unemployment or low-skill job is inferred from the long-standing grievance and potential difficulty maintaining employment due to injury or psychological impact.",

        "The construction of devices, use of timing mechanisms, and encrypted communication indicate a level of technical understanding and problem-solving ability, suggesting average to above-average intelligence. However, the homemade nature of explosives and the grammatical errors in communications suggest potentially practical skills rather than advanced formal education."

The escalation phase with larger charges indicates a potential shift towards more impactful violence if demands are unmet.",

However, the subject still mitigates personal risk by avoiding forensic evidence and using public Wi-Fi.",
