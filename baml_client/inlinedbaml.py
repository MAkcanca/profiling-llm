Use the evidence assessment to create a comprehensive offender profile following the structured format. Be evidence-based, methodical, and specific in your analysis, drawing connections between evidence and profile elements.Reason step by step, in the final answer, provide the reasoning for each step.\r\n    # CRIMINAL PROFILING PROCESS\r\n\r\n    To create a comprehensive offender profile for this case, follow these steps:\r\n    1.

Analyze this evidence using the profiling frameworks\r\n    3. Create a comprehensive offender profile that includes demographic, psychological, behavioral, geographic, skills, investigative implications, and identifying characteristics\r\n    4. Include framework classifications with confidence ratings\r\n    5.

Extensive planning and preparation\r\n    - Victim selection based on specific criteria aligning with fantasy\r\n    - Offense-specific tools/weapons prepared in advance\r\n    - Calm, methodical emotional state before the offense\r\n    - Detailed sadistic fantasy development over time\r\n    - Evidence of sexual preoccupation and deviant sexual interests\r\n    - Often consumes sadistic pornography\r\n\r\n    Crime Scene Indicators:\r\n\r\n    -

Post-mortem sexual activity\r\n    - Meticulous crime scene (staged or cleaned)\r\n    - Body disposal planned and executed carefully\r\n    - Trophy-taking or souvenirs from victims\r\n    - Erotic/sexual mutilation\r\n\r\n    Offender Characteristics:\r\n\r\n    -

Limited criminal history prior to murder\r\n    - Developmental history often includes humiliation and attachment issues\r\n    - Psychopathic traits, particularly emotional detachment\r\n    - Sexual sadism diagnosis common\r\n\r\n    PATHWAY 2: ANGRY PATHWAY (framework_id: shpaf_angry)\r\n    Description: Sexual homicide resulting from intense anger, rage, or vengeance, where sexual elements serve as vehicles for expression of aggression rather than primary gratification.\r\n    Primary Motivation: Expression of rage, revenge, or perceived grievances\r\n    Pre-Crime Characteristics:\r\n\r\n    - Limited planning beyond target selection\r\n    - Triggering event often present (rejection, conflict, perceived slight)\r\n    - Intense negative emotional state prior to offense (anger, humiliation)\r\n    -

Lower intelligence than sadistic pathway\r\n\r\n    PATHWAY 3: SEXUALLY OPPORTUNISTIC PATHWAY (framework_id: shpaf_opportunistic)\r\n    Description: Sexual homicide occurring as an extension of a sexual assault, where homicide is instrumental (not planned) to silence the victim, avoid detection, or in response to unexpected victim resistance.\r\n    Primary Motivation: Sexual gratification initially, with homicide serving instrumental purposes\r\n    Pre-Crime Characteristics:\r\n\r\n    - Minimal planning of homicide component\r\n    - Initial intent focused on sexual assault only\r\n    - Moderate emotional arousal prior to offense\r\n    - Often impaired by substance use\r\n    - Often has history of non-homicidal sexual offenses\r\n    -

Moderate psychopathic traits\r\n    - Mixed personality pathology\r\n    - Impulsivity and poor problem-solving skills\r\n    - Often younger than other pathways\r\n    - Less sophisticated fantasy development\r\n    - Situational and contextual factors highly influential\r\n  \r\n    3. Spatial Behavioral Analysis:\r\n    Make sure to use the following indicators and provide confidence along with the reasoning as shown.\r\n      - Spatial Dispersion: Marauders show clustering around anchor points; commuters show clear separation between anchor and crime locations\r\n      - Buffer Zone Analysis: Marauders typically avoid immediate home area; commuters show no pattern relative to home area\r\n      - Transportation Evidence: Marauders often travel by foot or minimal transportation; commuters demonstrate consistent transportation methods over longer distances\r\n      - Environmental Knowledge: Marauders exploit detailed local knowledge; commuters select environments based on specific attributes regardless of familiarity\r\n      - Target Selection: Marauders often select opportunistic targets within zone; commuters may travel specifically for particular target types\r\n\r\n    MARAUDER (framework_id: spatial_marauder):\r\n    Description: Offender operates from a fixed geographic anchor point (typically residence) and commits crimes within their established comfort zone; demonstrates spatial behavior consistent with concentric zone patterns\r\n    Indicators:\r\n    - Crime locations form a clustered pattern around a central anchor point\r\n    - Evidence of localized environmental knowledge and familiarity\r\n    - Presence of a \"buffer zone\" immediately surrounding residence where crimes are avoided\r\n    - Consistent return to familiar territories for criminal activity\r\n    - Limited transportation requirements or evidence of walking to crime scenes\r\n    - Selection of targets based on proximity rather than specific characteristics\r\n\r\n    COMMUTER (framework_id: spatial_commuter):\r\n    Description: Offender travels outside their home/anchor area to commit crimes; maintains deliberate geographic separation between personal and criminal domains\r\n    Indicators:\r\n    - Clear spatial distinction between residence/work zones and offense locations\r\n    - Willingness to cross jurisdictional boundaries to commit crimes\r\n    - Evidence of targeted location selection based on specific environmental variables\r\n    - Consistent travel patterns to crime scenes (particular routes or transportation methods)\r\n    - Absence of spatial clustering around residential areas\r\n    - Crimes may demonstrate consistency in environmental characteristics despite geographic dispersion\r\n    - Greater average distance between anchor points and crime scenes compared to marauder pattern\r\n\"#\r\n\r\n// Examine {{ _.role(\"system\") }} because it was causing issues with the models like deepseek\r\ntemplate_string CaseDataTemplate(case_data: string) #\"\r\n    {{ _.role(\"system\") }}\r\n    {{ SystemMessage() }}\r\n    {{ _.role(\"user\") }}\r\n    You are an expert criminal profiler specializing in psychological and behavioral analysis.
