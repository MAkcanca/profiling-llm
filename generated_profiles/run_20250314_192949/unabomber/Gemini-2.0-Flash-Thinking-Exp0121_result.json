      "stress_factors": "Potential stressors include professional failures, perceived lack of recognition, or resentment towards academic or technological institutions. The victim's controversial publication could be a trigger or focus of resentment, but the pattern suggests broader institutional targeting.",

While motivation might stem from personal resentment, the execution is methodical and focused on achieving a specific outcome (disruption, fear, injury to a representative of a targeted field) rather than emotional expression or personal revenge in a direct sense. Confidence is high due to strong alignment with multiple indicators, although the 'REVENGEFUL MISSION' archetype shares some similarities but lacks the direct personal link to a specific individual for revenge as the primary driver, making 'PROFESSIONAL' a slightly better fit for the overarching pattern."

        "The 'COMMUTER' spatial behavior is more likely given the postal origin in California and the pattern of similar bombings across various states. This geographic dispersion suggests the offender is traveling to mail the devices and potentially to research or select targets, rather than operating solely within a localized area around a residence. Confidence is moderate as the exact anchor point is unknown, but the long-distance mailing and multi-state targeting strongly indicate commuter behavior. Further investigation into the offender's potential location in relation to Oakland, CA, and victim locations would strengthen this classification."
