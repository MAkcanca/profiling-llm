        "**Age Range (45-65):** Surveillance footage suggests 'middle-aged'. Communications reference injury in 'early 2000s' and '13 years waiting', pointing to someone older than mid-30s. Assuming injury occurred around age 30-40, current age would be in this range.",
        "**Gender (MALE):** Grievance related to workplace injury in utilities sector is statistically more associated with male-dominated professions. Surveillance footage depicts an 'individual' which lacks specific gender indicators but given the context male is more probable.",
        "**Employment (Former manual worker/unemployed/retired):** Grievance centers on workplace injury at EGU. Skills in bomb-making suggest some technical aptitude, possibly from manual labor background. Unemployment or retirement could explain time available for device construction and attacks.",
        "**Relationship Status (Isolated):** Communications are focused on grievance, lacking social context. Actions are solitary, suggesting social isolation. Lack of personal connections implied by anonymity and indirect communication methods.",
        "**Living Arrangements (Living Alone):**  Social isolation and focus on grievance suggest minimal social network, possibly living alone. This would provide more opportunity and less scrutiny for planning and executing offenses.",
        "**Education/Intelligence (Skilled Trade/Average to Above Average):** Bomb-making requires some technical skill and planning, indicating at least average intelligence. Grammatical issues in communications suggest possible non-native English speaker or foreign education, or simply lower formal education level, but technical skills suggest practical intelligence."

      "reasoning": [
        "**Personality (Resentful/Methodical/Paranoid):** Long-term grievance, repeated references to being 'wronged', and meticulous device construction point to resentment and methodical nature. Surveillance avoidance and encrypted emails suggest paranoia or heightened caution.",
        "**Need for Power/Control (Low General, High Grievance-Related):** Actions are not about general domination, but specifically about EGU. The goal is to be heard and compensated, suggesting a need for grievance recognition rather than broad power seeking.",
        "**Social Skills (Poor):** Indirect communication via bombs and notes, avoidance of direct confrontation, and anonymity indicate poor social skills and preference for non-personal interaction. Reluctance to be seen on camera reinforces social avoidance.",
        "**Stressors (Workplace Injury/Injustice/Lack of Compensation):** Communications explicitly state workplace injury in 'early 2000s', lack of compensation, and feeling wronged by EGU. These form the core stressors driving the actions.",

This suggests a calculated approach to risk-taking, where risks are weighed against perceived gains (grievance recognition).",
