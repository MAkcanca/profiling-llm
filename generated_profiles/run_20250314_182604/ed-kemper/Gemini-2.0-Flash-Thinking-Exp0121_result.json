Dismemberment is a significant aspect of the violence, suggesting it is not merely to dispose of the body but has a deeper, possibly ritualistic or gratification-based purpose. Gunshot wound is the primary cause of death, but dismemberment and sexual assault are significant elements.",

Risk-taking is evident in approaching victims for abduction and transporting bodies, but efforts are made to minimize detection through remote disposal sites and dismemberment to potentially hinder identification.
