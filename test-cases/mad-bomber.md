EGU facilities (7 incidents)



DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS
Construction

Brass pipe (typically 3-4 inches long, 3/4 inch diameter)
End caps secured with pipe compound
Homemade energetic material (potassium nitrate, charcoal, sulfur mixture)
Early devices used simple fuses
Later devices incorporated electronic timing mechanisms
Distinctive red fabric (sock or similar material) frequently used as wrapping
Often contained within small wooden boxes or containers

Forensic Analysis

No fingerprints recovered from device components
No DNA profiles recovered despite extensive swabbing
No commercial tool marks identified
Typography on printed notes consistent across incidents
Powder composition consistent, suggesting same manufacturer
Metal sourcing analysis suggests common origin for pipe materials
Evidence of meticulous assembly with precision tools

COMMUNICATIONS
The unknown subject has sent seventeen communications to various media outlets since 2017:
Content Analysis

Consistent references to being "wronged" by Eastern Grid Utilities
Claims of workplace injury in "early 2000s"
Repeated phrase "fair consideration" appears in 11 communications
Sign-off consistently includes the initials "F.C."
Grammar and syntax suggest possibly non-native English speaker or foreign education
Communications evolved from physical letters to encrypted emails (2019-present)
IP addresses traced to various public Wi-Fi locations throughout the city

Selected Quotes from Communications

"The public must be warned against EGU and their disregard for worker safety."
"My condition from their negligence goes uncompensated. Justice will be served."
"Thirteen years I have waited for fairness. F.C. will be heard."
"2008 was when they caused my illness. They refuse responsibility."
"This will continue until proper recognition and compensation is given."

SURVEILLANCE DATA
Limited surveillance data exists due to the subject's apparent awareness of camera locations:

Transit Center security footage (July 2022) captured individual in dark jacket and baseball cap placing package near lockers
Metropolitan Cinema security footage (October 2021) shows middle-aged individual entering with small package and exiting without it
Partial facial images captured but insufficient for facial recognition match
Subject appears to deliberately avoid direct camera exposure
Gait analysis suggests possible right leg injury or impairment

INJURY ASSESSMENT
Despite the number of devices, relatively few serious injuries have occurred:

Total reported injuries: 15
Most serious: lacerations requiring hospitalization (3 cases)
Majority of injuries: minor burns, contusions, hearing damage
No fatalities to date
Pattern suggests devices intentionally placed to minimize casualties while maximizing public attention

INVESTIGATIVE ACTIONS TO DATE

Complete forensic analysis of all recovered device components
Review of Eastern Grid Utilities employment records 2000-2010
Analysis of industrial accident claims filed against EGU 2000-2010
Worker's compensation denial appeals 2000-2010
